First Programming Assignment
Due  9-22-17 at 11PM.

0. Modify the postfix program post.cpp to handle both subtraction and
division:

Sample input:

./a.out 4 10 - 6 x 12 /

Sample output:

-3

Your program should be named 0.cpp and placed in your pgm directory.


1. Write a program to fill in a two-dimensional array of boolean values by
setting a[i][j] to 1 if the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1.
Else if the greatest common divisor is not 1, then set a[i][j] to 0.

Sample Input:
 ./a.out 6

Sample Output:

0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0

Place this program in your pgm directory and call it 1.cpp.

2. Write a program to solve the Josephus problem, with the following
modification:

Sample Input:

./a.out n m p

where n is the number of players and m is the count used for every odd
turn while p is the count used for every even turn.


./a.out 5 2 3


Sample Output:

Round 1:

1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Round 2:

1 -> 3 -> 4

Round 3:

1 -> 4

Round 4:

1

Winner is 1.

Place this program in your pgm directory and name it 2.cpp

3. When is a graph a tree? Write a program that will read from a file
specified on the command line and determine from the graph's adjacency
matrix whether or not it is a tree.

Example:

./a.out graph.txt

Output:

The graph is a tree!

Contents of graph.txt will be something like this:

5
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0

To be graded, your program must be in your pgm
and named precisely as 3.cpp.
