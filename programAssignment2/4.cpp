In ANSII standard C++, there is no library function to convert an
integer to a string. Your program should develop such a
function. In other words complete the following program using your
itos function. (Use of other C functions is prohibitted)

// this program will read in an integer and convert it to a string

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string itos(int n) {
}


int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	int n = atoi(argv[1]);
	cout << "file "+ itos(n)+ " .txt" << endl;
	return 0;
}

To be graded, your program must be in your pgm
and named precisely as 4.cpp.
